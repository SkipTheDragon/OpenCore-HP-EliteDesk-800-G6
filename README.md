## Not Working/Bugs

- Sleep
- Sometimes Bluetooth peripherials get randomly disconnected.
- Scrolling through Photos App sometimes will produce a kernel panic

## How to use

1. Create the USB stick per [Dortania's Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/) and add the recovery image in case you didn't have macOS installed already.
2. Copy the EFI/ folder to your stick.
3. Make sure you have set the BIOS settings right.
4. Enjoy! (That means install macOS, you are on your own now.)

## Side Notes

1. The EliteDesk comes pre-installed with a AX201 most of the time, but since Bluetooth is quite troublesome in general for Hackintosh you must disable it, but surprise, you cannot disable Bluetooth on this card so you are forced to buy a AX200 card and then go to BIOS and disable BlueTooth.
2. FileVault is working but I disabled it because I have a BT keyboard and it won't load Bluetooth drivers or the USB prorts unless you input the password.
3. I already had some Apple devices so I didn't have to configure anything or it to work.

## P.S

Originally this EFI was taken from [Olarila](https://www.olarila.com/topic/30638-monterey-126-on-hp-prodesk-600-g6/). All I did was update it to the latest version and fix my BT and WIFI.
